# Linear-Regression
Linear regression is a statistical model that predicts the relationship between a dependent variable (y) and one or more independent variables (x) by fitting a linear equation to observed data. It assumes a straight-line connection between the variables and estimates the best line that minimizes the differences between predicted and actual values.
